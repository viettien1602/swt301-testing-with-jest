# Testing with JEST framework Repository: Team SWT301 FALL 2022

## Testing JS algorithm using JEST framework
You will find in this session:
* A simple problem will be solved by Hash algorithm, and we will use JEST to test the accuracy of it
* Steps to test:
    1. Using Brute Force algorithm to create test case and correct answer
    2. Using test case to test Hash algorithm
    3. See the test result

## Testing JS data structure (basic blockchain implementation) using JEST framework
You will find in this session:
* A simple implementation of blockchain structure. If you want to get more details to the blockchain, find out at: [BlockChain details](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiTqZmbtFisdXFxul5k0F-Q4)
* Test cases to test the blockchain created with JEST framework:
    1. A new block added must have hash matching difficulty
    2. A new block added must have prevHash matching the hash of last block of blockchain
    3. A new block added must have data immutable
    4. Not changing any data, the whole blockchain should return valid status
    5. Changing data of block 1 only, The whole blockchain should return invalid status
    6. Changing data and hash of block 1, The whole blockchain should return invalid status

## Setup - teardown demo in JEST


## Mock function demo in JEST
You will find in this session:
* A simple implementation of calling another function to retrieve data from database, which points out the problem why we should apply mock function in unit testing
* 2 ways of creating mock function in JEST
    * Conducting a manual mock function by overriding the original one
    * JEST framework supports us an operation to create mock function, which can mock implementation or mock the return value
